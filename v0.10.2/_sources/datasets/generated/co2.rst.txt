Mauna Loa Weekly Atmospheric CO2 Data
=====================================

Description
-----------


Atmospheric CO2 from Continuous Air Samples at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, U.S.A.

Period of Record: March 1958 - December 2001

Methods: An Applied Physics Corporation (APC) nondispersive infrared gas analyzer was used to obtain atmospheric CO2 concentrations, based on continuous data (four measurements per hour) from atop intake lines on several towers. Steady data periods of not less than six hours per day are required; if no such six-hour periods are available on any given day, then no data are used that day. Weekly averages were calculated for most weeks throughout the approximately 44 years of record. The continuous data for year 2000 is compared with flask data from the same site in the graphics section.
