Travel Mode Choice
==================

Description
-----------

The data, collected as part of a 1987 intercity mode choice
study, are a sub-sample of 210 non-business trips between Sydney, Canberra and
Melbourne in which the traveler chooses a mode from four alternatives (plane,
car, bus and train). The sample, 840 observations, is choice based with
over-sampling of the less popular modes (plane, train and bus) and under-sampling
of the more popular mode, car. The level of service data was derived from highway
and transport networks in Sydney, Melbourne, non-metropolitan N.S.W. and Victoria,
including the Australian Capital Territory.

Notes
-----
::

    Number of observations: 840 Observations On 4 Modes for 210 Individuals.
    Number of variables: 8
    Variable name definitions::

        individual = 1 to 210
        mode =
            1 - air
            2 - train
            3 - bus
            4 - car
        choice =
            0 - no
            1 - yes
        ttme = terminal waiting time for plane, train and bus (minutes); 0
               for car.
        invc = in vehicle cost for all stages (dollars).
        invt = travel time (in-vehicle time) for all stages (minutes).
        gc = generalized cost measure:invc+(invt*value of travel time savings)
            (dollars).
        hinc = household income ($1000s).
        psize = traveling group size in mode chosen (number).
