    "- small samples favor the null hypothesis. Uncertainty in small samples is large and the hypothesis test has little power. The study in this case is underpowered and we often cannot reject the null because of large uncertainty. Non-rejection cannot be taken as evidence in favor of the null because the hypothesis test does not have much power to reject the null.\n",
    "- large samples favor the alternative hypothesis. In large samples uncertainty becomes small, and even small deviations from the null hypothesis will lead to rejection. In this case we can have a test result that shows an effect that is statistical significant but substantive irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noninferiority and equivalence tests solve both problems. The first problem, favoring the null in small samples, can be avoided by reversing null and alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis should be the one we want to show, so the test does not just support the hypothesis of interest because the power is too small. The second problem, favoring the alternative in large samples, can be voided but specifying a margin in the hypothesis test, so that trivial deviations are still part of the null hypothesis. By using this, we are not favoring the alternative in large samples for irrelevant deviations of a point null hypothesis. Noninferiority tests want to show that a treatment is almost as good as the control. Equivalence test try to show that the statistics in two samples are approximately the same, in contrast to a point hypothesis that specifies that they are exactly the same.\n"
